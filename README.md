# VGA_FONTS

The three most standard VGA fonts were taken from https://github.com/dokkaebi-project/font-archive (the fntcol16.zip archive) and converted to PSF.

FYI, PSF Tools (https://www.seasip.info/Unix/PSF/) is useful for converting raw fonts to PSF and beyond.

Also, here's a good tutorial for turning bitmap fonts to ttf: https://gist.github.com/ZoomTen/478de2494e9f7cd88be83422ce047122
